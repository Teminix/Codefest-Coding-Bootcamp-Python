# For loops are definite loops, we know when the loop will end

# The below code will print out the elements in a list
myList = ['Hello world',23,1.0,3.141,69,False] # Declare list with items in them
for i in myList: # The CURRENT item in the list is the variable named 'i'
	print(i)

# We can use a range function to print a range of numbers
for i in range(23, 50):
	print(i)
